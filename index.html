                <h5>What is UX Strategy?</h5>
                <p>"The better the user experience, the better your chances of capturing interest and driving conversions. <br>
                    The challenge? Given the scope and scale of addressing every potential website issue — and balancing the needs and wants of multiple users with different priorities — trying to create UX that’s everything to everyone often ends with the opposite result.<br>
                    "UX strategy helps solve this issue by identifying which features have the biggest impact on overall user experience, which functions need the most improvement, and how current technology and budget limitations inform both of these needs."</p>

                <h5>UX Strategy Components                </h5>
                <P>Now let’s look at the components that make up a good UX Strategy.</P>

                    <li>Long-Term Vision</li>

                <h5>Why does UX strategy matter?</h5>
                <p>You’ve probably seen the often-referenced statistic that if sites don’t load within three seconds (or so), consumers will take their business elsewhere. While it remains a relevant metric — Google recently started factoring in page speed as part of their site ranking analysis — speed alone isn’t enough to deliver great UX.<br><br>

                    Here’s why: according to recent survey data, while 20% of users ranked slow load times as their biggest site frustration, 24% pointed to overall page unreliability, which includes page elements randomly moving or not displaying properly along with 404 errors and broken links. 15%, meanwhile, pointed to pop-up ads and 13% said advertisements negatively impacted their experience.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>For business owners, the implication is clear: While page speed helps get users onto your site, it’s not enough to keep them. If pages don’t load properly, navigation is difficult or ads are overwhelming, any goodwill you’ve built up from quick loading times vanishes almost instantly.<br><br>

                        Combined with rapidly-changing consumer behavior — such as the move to mobile-first connections and the desire for seamless customer service across multiple channels — the experience becomes the defining factor in site success.

                <h5 style="color:rgb(16, 17, 17)">The Google search page is a thing of UX beauty. Here’s why: It’s simple and does exactly what you’d expect. While there are options to access Gmail, Google Images, or your Google Account, the vast majority of the webpage is white space. 

                    What we like: Clean lines and minimal clutter make the central search bar the primary focus and there’s no confusion for users about how the search function works.</p>

New users are given specific tasks to accomplish that help them “get the most out of LinkedIn,” with each task broken down into simple steps that start with a single click.

Visitors find a simple form that asks what type of care they want — boarding, house sitting, dog walking, etc. — where they live when they need care, and what size dog or cat they have.

                    Armed with this information, Rover can quickly generate relevant search results that reduce the amount of time that users have to spend sifting through care information that isn’t applicable to their circumstances.

                </h5>
                <p>In a recent Fast Company article, he notes that many UX efforts “amount to little more than UX theatre: creating the appearance of due diligence and a patina of legitimacy that’s just enough to look like a robust design process.” In other words, most UX efforts are just for show.</p>
